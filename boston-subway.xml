                    MANY KILLED BY EXPLOSION

                    Escaping Gas in Boston Subway Works Great Havoc.

                    HALF A HUNDRED INJURED

                    Passing Electric Cars Wrecked and Adjoining Buildings Badly Damaged-Partial List of Dead and Disabled Accident Occurred at Tremont and Boylston Streets.

                    An explosion has just occurred in the subway excavation at the corner of Tremont and Boylston streets.

                    Three electric cars that were passing at the time were wrecked and one of them was burned. Several buildings in the vicinity were more or less damaged.

                    The explosion was caused by escaping gas. Among the buildings damaged are the Hotel Pelham, the Knickerbocker and Head buildings and the Masonic Temple. Window glass in buildings within 200 feet of the scene of the explosion were shattered.

                    At least twelve persons were killed. Four bodies have been removed to undertaking rooms.

                    Forty-two persons are at the Emergency Hospital.

                    Among the dead are: Rev. W. A. Black, professor at Tufts College. G. D. Bigelow, conductor. Unknown man and woman.

                    The injured include James Reardon. John J. O'Connor, Thonsas F. Ford, Mrs. J. R. Wilson, Nellie Jackson, Lucy Dolan, F. W. Teeling, and Mrs. F. A. Peck

                    There seems to be no doubt that at least eight persons were immediately killed. The explosion came just as the street cars were almost in the center of the space at the corner.

                    The first car was in the center when the explosion came. The whole of the wood work, which is used as a bridge over the subway, was lifted into the air, carrying the first car with it and taking along the two horses of the second car. The other vehicles were lifted straight into the air. but came down on the tracks. Instantly the air was filled with flying debris.

                    The first electric car, the one in which most of the killed were riding, no sooner reached the track than it broke in half, and the whole portion immediately burst into flame. Then someone sounded a fire alarm. This brought a large rescue force to the scene, and almost immediately calls were being sent out hurriedly for the ambulances.

                    It was an awful sight that met the gaze of those who were first on the scene. In the center was the long blazing electric car. Close beride this were the bodies of the two horses killed instantly, and about ten, twenty, thirty feet away from where the woodwork of the car was blazing lay the dead and wounded people. Those who were not injured in the cars on Boylston street were Incapable of action at first, and people in the buildings and stores surrounding did not know what had occurred, but it did not take them long to secure their senses, and almost immediately there was a rush to the assistance of the wounded.

                    It is stated that there was not a person on the three cars who was not injured, and all the wounds received were severe. Immediately stores and offices were converted into temporary hospitals until ambulances could arrive. It was a gruesome spectacle to see these bodies exposed on the sidewalks.

                    Hose carriages were pressed into service as ambulances, and immediately they were started on their humane duty of getting the maimed to the hospitals.

                    UNDERGROUND TRAVEL.

                    THE BOSTON SUBWAY PARTLY COMPLETED AND IN OPERATION.

                    A BRIGHTLY LIGHTED TUNNEL AFFORDING RAPID TRANSIT FOR ELECTRIC CARS CONGESTION OF THE STREETS RELIEVED.

                    The subway for streetcars in Boston, a part of which has just been opened for service, is an enterprise of more than local interest. The necessity for some relief to the crowded thoroughfares above it can best be appreciated, of course, by Bostonians; but the Modern Athens is by no means the only city in this country which is beset with problems of the same character.

                    Those who are familiar with "the lay of the land" in Boston remember that Tremont-st. runs in a generally north-and-south direction and forms the eastern boundary of the Common. It is intersected by Boylston-st., which constitutes the southern boundary of that historic park. On the Boylston and Tremont st edges of the Common there is a broad promenade, known as the Mall. The main part of the subway, which is wide enough to accommodate four tracks, passes under the Tremont-st. Mall, and, after passing under Park-st., which lies along the northern side of the Common, extends (or will extend, when completed) to Scollay Square, thence eastward to Adams Square, and finally up northward again to Haymarket Square. This terminus is close to the great union railway station at the North End.

                    From the corner of Tremont and Boylston sts. there are two extensions, wide enough for only a double track. One runs westward under Boylston-st. Mall for about 300 feet, and then ascends an incline through an open cut for 318 feet. The terminal station for this branch is situated in the Public Gardens. The other branch reaches away to the southward, and, on nearing the junction of Shawmut-ave, and Tremont-st., forks. A separate two-track incline leads up into each of those streets.

                    Including the inclines, the subway has a total length of about a mile and a half, and will contain about five miles of track. At present the branches from the corner of Boylston and Tremont sts, and the main line up to Park-st. are in operation. A great deal of work has already been done on the northern portion of the route, and it is hoped that everything will be finished within the next eight months. Ground was broken for the subway in April, 1895, twenty-nine months ago.

                    The depth of this underground passageway is 14 feet. The width is 24 feet for two tracks, and 48 feet for four. At intervals of six feet, along the sides, steel posts are set up on good foundations, and from the tops of those on one side there reach across to the tops of those on the other steel roof beams. Where there are four tracks there is a central line of posts in the tunnel, in addition to those along the sides. From one cross beam to the next there extends an arch of masonry. These successive arches, forming the roof, are covered with concrete, and the same material fills the space between the posts along the sides. A waterproof backing of asphalt assists in excluding from the subway water that might otherwise leak in from the soil. The masonry floor is hollowed, like an inverted arch, and along its central line there runs a drain. At intervals the drain discharges into a pit, from which, whenever the water rises to a certain level, the contents are withdrawn by automatically controlled electric pumps.

                    Ventilation is effected by huge rotary fans, established in masonry chambers at three or four points along the line. The air is sucked out of the subway, and forced upward through the openings to the level of the street. Hundreds of incandescent electric lamps and scores of arc lights are disposed advantageously along the interior. As electricity is also employed for the propulsion of the cars which use the subway, there is no smoke to accumulate on the ceilings, and no foul gases to offend the olfactory nerves, There is no reason why the place should not remain clean, sweet and bright for years.

                    At the underground stations, of course, the subway is broadened. A high wire fence runs lengthwise in the middle, separating the two northbound tracks from the two southbound. The tracks of each pair are divided by what engineers call an "island platform," say 30 feet wide, and 300 or 100 feet long. Access can be had to one platform from the other only by going down a low flight of stairs and through a narrow but brightly illuminated passage underneath, or else going up to the street and crossing over.

                    The cars which run through the tunnel are ordinary trolley-cars, but, like many which traverse other routes in the city, they are all controlled by one corporation, the West End Street Railway Company, to which, by the way, the subway has been leased by the Transit Commissioners. This fact partially explains some of the precautions taken at the stations. There one buys a ticket before boarding a car, or getting a chance to do so, and the conductor on the car collects the tickets. Exit from the station platforms is effected through turnstiles, which allow a person to pass in only one direction.

                    Broad, easy stairs lead down from the street to the underground stations. There are seldom more than thirty steps in a flight. There are two flights for the northbound tracks, and two for the southbound. The head of each staircase is enclosed by a neat one-story, glass-roofed granite building. Glazed white brick and plenty of white paint impart to the station interiors a fresh and cheery appearance. At present the only stations in use underground are at the corner of Boylston and Tremont sts. and at Park-st. A temporary loop at the latter point permits the northbound cars to return without switching. When the subway is completed, however, there will be other stations at Scollay Square, Adams Square and Haymarket Square.

                    Only an engineer can begin to understand the difficulties of an undertaking like this. Countless sewers, water-pipes, gas-pipes and telephone wire conduits have been laid close to the route, and some of these have been bared during the progress of the necessary excavation. When their position was at a higher level than the roof of the future subway it was not necessary to do more than to protect them carefully for the time. But if they were lower than the roof, and higher than the floor, the situation was more serious. Two great water mains, one thirty inches in diameter and the other forty inches across, were encountered at that very inconvenient level. It became necessary to construct siphons, bending down under the subway and up again on the other side, in order to adjust these conflicts of interest. For the happy solution of all these difficulties great credit is due to the City Commission entrusted with the work, to their chief engineer, and, in some measure, to the engineers of the West End Company.

                    An incidental but important feature of the plan of construction is the avoidance of grade crossings. In the four-track passageway the Boylston-st. cars have the two inside tracks, and the Tremont-st. and Shawmut-ave. cars use the two outer ones in common. Accordingly, at the southeastern corner of the Common, the westernmost track (southbound) is carried down under the two central ones, by a special one-track tunnel which soon emerges with another one-track tunnel carrying the up-track. At a point still further south a similar plan is pursued in the separating of the Shawmut-ave. and Tremont-st. cars.

                    The capacity of the subway is ninety cars per minute. Inasmuch as the facilities thus afforded are supplementary to those already afforded on Tremont-st., and are not a substitute for the latter, a distinct increase in the number of routes, as well as freedom from blockades, has been secured.

                    SATISFACTORY SOLUTION OF THE STREET CAR PROBLEM.

                    Congestion of Traffic In the Busy Streets of the Hub Relieved by Underground Trolley Lines-Tunnels That Are Light, Clean and Attractive.

                    It is now possible to cross Tremont street, Boston, at any point opposite the Common and at any time of day without loss of life or limb. The new subway has brought about the change.

                    It is an old tradition that the fathers of Boston, when they laid out the city, let the streets follow the winding cow paths. At any rate, the streets as they exist today are very crooked and most of them are very narrow. This was all right in Revolutionary times, but when the city grew miles beyond the Common and spread itself out to the south and west; when business centered itself along the lower ends of Washington and Tremont streets, and when dozens of street car tracks usurped the narrow roadways, then the Bostonians wished their ancestors had not stuck so closely to the cow paths.

                    Probably no other city on the continent was ever so badly afflicted with a congestion of traffic as the Hub has been for many years. Some of the most important street car lines skirt the south and east corners of the Common on Boylston and Tremont streets. When the change was made from horsepower to trolley, matters grew worse. Then the poles and the tangle of overhead wires made that historic breathing spot look like a piece of dingy, green billiard cloth which had become frayed and tattered around the edges. So after much wrangling in the legislature and courts it was decided to build the subway and put the trolley cars underground.

                    A large portion of the work has already been accomplished and Boston is delighted with the result. The first thing a Boston man asks a visitor from New York, Chicago or elsewhere is: "Been through the subway yet? Let's see—you haven't one in your place, have you?"

                    It is, in fact, a triumph of engineering and well worth a visit. There are three open cuts where the trolley cars enter the subway. One is out on Tremont street where Shawmut avenue comes in. Here the tracks from each of those thoroughfares dive into the tunnel. Another is in the Public Gardens, where the cars coming down Boylston street take the underground dip. The third is at the northerly end of the subway, just beyond Haymarket square and in front of the new Union terminal railroad station into which the Fitchburg, Boston and Maine, Eastern and other roads run. There is a loop here as most of the trolley lines make it their terminus, and, the subway being four tracked, they disgorge their passengers and take the back track uptown.

                    Including the inclines or open cuts, the subway has a total length of 14 miles and will contain about five miles of track. At present the branch down Boylston street along the Common side and the main line down Tremont to Park street are in operation. The Shawmut avenue branch and the northerly end of the main line will be finished within the next eight months. Ground was broken for the subway in April, 1895. The sum appropriated was $7,000,000 and, wonderful to relate, the transit commissioners say that it is probable the cost will be about $1,000,000 less than that sum.

                    No great difficulties have been encountered thus far in digging this big hole in the ground. Of course there were countless sewers, water pipes, gas pipes, electric wire conduits and the like and some 40-inch water mains at an inconvenient level proved rather hard to handle, but no unexpected conditions arose to delay the work. The main trunk of the subway runs under the wide walk or mall on the east side of the Common, and when the excavations were being made the bones of hundreds of old Puritans were disturbed. This raised a howl of righteous indignation, and the sacredness of the long forgotten burying ground was harped upon for weeks. But the commissioners quieted the reverent patriots by collecting all the bones and reinterring them in the holy ground of the Common, with a nice monument to mark the spot.

                    The deepest point of the subway is on Boylston street, where the southbound tracks are laid 39 feet below the surface, but the average depth is 14 feet. The tunnel itself is a giant bore with ribs of steel and casings of cement, asphalt, concrete and masonry. The roof is a series of arches and the floor is concave, with drains at the bottom. As the drains are below the level of the sewers, pits have been established at intervals, and when they are filled with water automatic electrical pumps are started, which empty them into the sewers above.

                    Perhaps you imagine that Boston's subway is a dark, damp, ill-smelling place. It is nothing of the sort. The entrances to the stations are handsome structures of stone, with glass roofs. The only fault to be found with them is that they remind one of something one thought of the first time they saw one. But then you go down an easy flight of wide stone steps to a cheerful, brilliantly lighted station. Everything is dazzlingly white. The bricks lining the entrance are of glazed white porcelain, the masonry arches are painted white and the iron pillars and supports are covered with immaculate white enamel. Incandescent and arc lights flash everywhere, and the vista ahead through the stretches of the subway is far from a dingy one. It is about the cleanest and neatest hole in the ground in existence and no doubt will be kept so. Already the traffic on Tremont and Boylston streets has been much decreased, and when the subway is fully completed Boston folk may get about their town with comparative ease and safety.

                    UNDERGROUND TRANSIT A FAILURE IN ACTUAL PRACTICE

                    People Refuse to Een It, Just ne They Wanld the Stole in the Ground Transit Proposed for New York-Only Beven Per Cent. of the Total Trame Credited to the flubway-The Profitable Fancy Traffle Lest to It Entirely -Yot the Conditions Are Most Favorable Boston Wants as Elevated Ratirend Now,

                    Before any further attempt is made to com- sait this city to the building of the proposed underground system of rapid transit it would be well for every one interested to learn some- thing of the experience which Boston is now having with its subway. Boston's subway is New York's proposed underground railroad in miniature, except that it was constructed for the use of the trolley car lines instead of being equipped with cars, motors, and power of its own, and running two sets of trains-one express and one local.

                    The Boston subway is short. That part now in use is less than a mile in length, and the parts which are under construction or proposed would add only about another mile to the tunnel. There is, perhaps, no finer specimen of passenger tunnel work anywhere in the world, and it is doubtful if any more perfect tunnel could be constructed.

                    The tunnel runs under Tremont street, and Its extensions are to go under Cornhill, Hanover street, and Washington street, passing right through the dense business and shopping districts, and thus securing every advantage that a road might have if it ran through Broadway, Fourteenth street and Twenty-third street, and part of Sixth avenue. And yet, in the face of all these advantages, three months' experience has shown that the Boston subway is not popular, that people will not go into it except when they have to, and that the subway is a failure, save so far as it was a necessity to relieve the congestion of traffic on the street.

                    Bostonians are proud of the subway. They take strangers to see it, just as they take them to see Bunker Hill Monument; make them ride the length of it back and forth, and call attention to all its fine features and then they keep away from it themselves, just as they do from the monument. That this result is of interest to New Yorkers there can be no doubt. The building of the subway grew out of a public need which was as absolute and pressing as the need of this city for some addition to its traffic facilities.

                    When, about ten years ago, the West End Street Railway Company began to transform the old horse car lines of Boston into electric trolley lines, the narrow streets in the heart of Boston were already choked with the daily rush of vehicles. Boston has today the most extensive and comprehensive electric car system in the world. The added cars which were required for the new service fairly filled the streets of the little central city where they were all concentrated. These car lines serve a suburban population of nearly a million persons, and it is possible to take a car for any part of the territory covered without going more than a quarter of a mile in the city. Under a special act of the Legislature, the Boston Transit Commission was appointed to devise a suitable means to relieve the congestion.

                    Riding Astride Makes Little Headway Among Ladies

                    There is a rumor that the bean-eating, blue-blooded Boston dames have mounted a new hobby. They ride astride. Not the hobby, but the horse. They think this is a good time to begin, says the New York Sun, Since the Boston subway was completed, a large part of the population spends its time underground, riding back and forth through the tunnel and exclaiming: "We did It!"

                    This has increased the above-ground inhabitants to so small a number that It's a good time to overcome public opinion, because there's so little of it to overcome. Consequently, the Boston women referred to have seized the chance to establish the new fad in riding. They know that by the time the people get tired of looking at their hole in the ground, bloomers will have become a part of the Boston creed of B's. It's growing. Already it includes Boston beaus, Boston bays, Boston blue blood, and Boston bas bleus.

                    Within a few weeks, the same rumor has broken out nearer home. Newspaper paragraphs have declared that New York women, too, are going to abandon the side saddle and take to divided skirts. Doctors who have been consulted sigh and say they only wish the rumor would come true. They do what they can to push it along. They prescribe riding astride, and say it is the only healthful and safe way for anybody to ride. But they say that it's one of the prescriptions which New York women have so far declined to take.

                    And yet there is a persistent rumor in the air that women have been seen riding astride even in the park. The regular policemen have a certain reputation for blindness, but there is no particular reason why a park policeman should have trouble with his eyes. He ought to know if there are any visions of amazons in divided skirts fitting along the bridle paths there summer days. Several policemen were, therefore, approached on the subject,

                    Historic Landmarks and Crooked Streets Disappearing.

                    Within three years the crooks and turnings and devious wanderings of Boston's most honored highways and byways will be nothing more than a memory of the past, and many of her ancient landmarks will be wiped out or so altered as to be unrecognizable to the oldest inhabitant. Slowly and surely the ancient thoroughfares are being widened, straightened and bent into the rulerlike lines of crosscut New-York, Philadelphia and Chicago. Boston is undergoing a transformation below and aloft that would cause Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, Warren and Paul Revere to rub their eyes and stare in amazement. Million dollar buildings by the dozen, elevated roads, tunnels and streetcar lines beneath the streets and under the harbor, swamps and mud flats filled in for piers and excavated for docks that accommodate giant steamers-these are the things they would see.

                    Along State-st., beneath the spot where the Boston Massacre occurred, and beneath the historic old State House, a tunnel is eating its way from under the harbor to Scollay Square to connect with the present subway by means of flights of stairs and elevators, and thence outside to the busy world. The old State House itself is to be transformed into a tunnel station connecting with a subway line also. The remodelled building will soon be crowded with people hurrying back and forth, intent on business, with never a thought of its old associations. Little do they think, as they hurry past where tunnel workmen are digging seventy feet beneath, of what has happened in that quaint old edifice. On this site the first State House was built in 1657. Destroyed by fire in 1711, it was rebuilt in 1712, and rebuilt again in 1747, when destroyed a second time. The building has been in turn Town House, Courthouse, Province House, State House and City Hall. On the first floor in the early days was the merchants' walk, or exchange.

                    During the Stamp Act excitement the stamped clearances were burned in front of its doors. The British troops were quartered within the building in 1768, and the Boston Massacre occurred about fifty feet away on March 5, 1770. The next day Samuel Adams stood in the council chamber and made his successful demand upon the royal representatives for the immediate removal of the British troops from Boston. In this same room Generals Clinton, Howe and Gage held a council of war just before the battle of Bunker Hill. In 1789, at the western end of the State House, Washington reviewed the great procession in his honor on the occasion of his last visit to Boston. Here, also, in 1835, William Lloyd Garrison found refuge from a mob which had broken up an anti-slavery meeting, and threatened his life.

                    The Park-st. station of the present subway handles 27,000,000 passengers a year in the course of its trolley traffic, but the number of passengers who will pass through the old State House station will far exceed this number.

                    The march of progress does not stop here, however. Down Washington-st., to connect with the tunnel and present subway, will be another subway, this a double one for elevated trains after they leave the surface at the Broadway extension. It will pass beneath the Old South Church, the Old Corner Bookstore and other well-known landmarks. Through the tower of the Old South Church, which juts out into Washington-st., it is planned to cut an arcade, in the general scheme of widening and straightening Washington-st. Surrounding the Old South Church on three sides, a new $1,000,000 office building eleven stories high is going up rapidly. The Old South Church has been called the "Sanctuary of Freedom." The ground on which it stands was formerly the site of Governor John Winthrop's home, where he died in 1649. The land was afterward owned by Mme. Mary Norton, wife of the Rev. John Norton, who gave it in trust "forever, for the erecting of a house for their assembling themselves together publicly to worship God."

                    East Boston Tunnel, Just Opened, Runs Under Harbor.

                    Boston, the pioneer city of America in subway construction, now boasts a subway said to be the greatest single boring yet completed under the water of a river or harbor. It is the East Boston tunnel, extending from the "city proper" under the harbor to Maverick square, East Boston. It is the second subway to be opened in Boston, was begun in 1900, has cost $3,000,000 and has just been turned over to the Boston Elevated Railway company for operation. It is about one and two-fifth miles in length and has an exterior diameter of nearly thirty feet, though the thickness of the walls brings its interior diameter down to about twenty-four feet.

                    The East Boston tunnel runs to a depth of more than ninety feet below the waters of Boston harbor through a blue clay sediment. It is for the use of regulation trolley cars, which come to the surface at the suburban end of the passage and continue their journeys over the street tracks. Eventually the tube will be connected directly with the present subway in Boston's congested district.

                    Lives Imperilled in Boston's Underground Railway.

                    Terrific Explosions Caused by Short Circuiting of Heavily Charged Electric Wires-Hundreds of Men and Women Thrown Into Panic-Three Persons Injured.

                    A blast of a charge of dynamite under tons of granite, and clouds of black, sickening smoke belching forth, threw hundreds of men and women into a panic and paralyzed traffic in the subway at the Boylston street station at 5:30 o'clock, Wednesday afternoon.

                    No one knew the trouble. Elevated road employees and officials were alike confused, and fearful of what might come next, as the smoke rapidly filled the stations at Boylston and Park streets, and passengers were rushed from the cars to the surface.

                    Attempts to call the fire department found the telephones so charged with electricity as to be useless.

                    Many of the women reaching the subway by the Boylston street cars were overcome by the smoke, fainted, and had to be dragged to the surface. Several became hysterical and were controlled with much difficulty, the danger being constant of someone falling from the platforms overcome by the smoke and becoming electrocuted upon the deadly third rail.

                    Trainmaster Benjamin was the first official to reach the Boylston street station and to bring some sort of order out of the chaos. Entering the subway along the line of the northbound cars, he made his way some 100 feet to the south of the station and found the cause of the trouble.

                    The feed cables for the third rail, running between the rails and enclosed in four-inch wooden box conduits, were found grounded and throwing off flashes of electricity, which illuminated the subway for many hundreds of feet. The electricity had jumped to other cables running parallel, and even charged the walls of the subway. Ten powerful cables felt the influence of the cross and were cracking and throwing off flames and flashes of light, threatening death to anyone who came near.

                    The wooden box conduit, black and greasy and very inflammable, was burning rapidly. A northbound train which had passed over the spot caught fire and was pulled back to Pleasant street, blazing fiercely underneath. The terrified passengers were hurried off at Pleasant street, and the fire beneath the curb was extinguished by road employees before serious damage was done.

                    Three persons were hurt, and all of them were on the surface. The accidents which caused their injuries were the direct result of the trouble in the subway. The injured were all near the Pleasant street entrance to the subway and were hurt by the explosions in three manholes at that point.

                    Trainmaster Benjamin ordered all trains into stations, and then the current on the third rail and feed cables was shut off.

                    Chief Mullen and the fire department had been notified before the power was shut off and entered the subway at the Boylston street station, although there was great danger for anyone, however familiar with the subway, to enter in the dense smoke which filled every foot of space between the walls.

                    As Chief Mullen's men touched the walls, they felt a shock at once. The brass nozzle of the chemical hose they carried became charged, and with electricity running up their arms, the men hesitated for a minute for orders from their chief.

                    "I'll risk it," shouted Chief Mullen, and he dashed into the smoke-filled subway. His men followed close behind, their hands on the shoulders of the men in front. A few daring newspaper men brought up the rear.

                    Half an hour was consumed in putting out the flames, which had followed along the box conduits nearly 300 yards.

                    Both Chief Mullen and Assistant Chief Brady termed it one of the most dangerous fires they were ever called upon to handle, not from its intensity but for the dangers of electrocution that surrounded them and the thickness of the smoke.

                    BOSTON'S SUBWAY, SURFACE AND ELEVATED LINES PRACTICALLY TIED UP BY STRIKE

                    By noonday the surface, elevated and subway car system of Boston and suburbs was utterly disorganized.

                    A strike of the union employees of the Boston Elevated, which controls the surface and subway lines, was called at 4:15 o'clock this morning after a stormy three-hour session at union headquarters.

                    The elevated officials laughed at the strike. When the union was formed only a few weeks ago the elevated set about a counter organization, a "protective" association they called it.

                    This morning the officials of the company claimed they had 2,000 men in this protective association who would continue to work, and that they had 1,500 strike-breakers already imported up from New York and Philadelphia.

                    There was a good deal of rioting after the strike was called. Cars were stoned, trolleys disconnected, motormen and conductors who refused to recognize the strike order roughly handled, sleepers were put on the tracks, and cautious Bostonians walked to work this morning.

                    But the rioting never became very serious and it was not necessary. As the forenoon wore on, motormen after motormen, and conductor after conductor left their packed cars standing in the street and went to union headquarters to report.

                    Even where they did not leave the cars there always was someone to disconnect the trolley wires. Then the motormen and conductors would refuse to get off to fix it, and the police would have to do it.

                    Because the guards at the Park street terminal of the Cambridge subway reported to the union the escalators were stopped and passengers had to climb three flights of stairs to the street.

                    There are 3,800 members of the union. The strike was called because:

                    The company refused to recognize the union; announced it would employ no union men.

                    When complaints were made against men, they were laid off without pay pending a hearing.

                    Conductors were forced to furnish $10 change for each trip.

                    Despite the company's refusal of an increase because their "finances would not stand it," the "loyal federation or protective association" members' pay was increased when the union was formed.

                    Police Commissioner O'Meara ordered all the reserves on duty at the subway and elevated stations and car barns this forenoon. There already have been fifty arrests, but all the cases were continued until Monday.

                    EXPLOSION SCARE IN BOSTON SUBWAY

                    23-Traffic was paralyzed for two hours, thousands of commuters and Christmas shoppers frightened in underground train when a main power cable in the Cambridge subway grounded and exploded, thus shutting off the current. Confusion broke loose in the vicinity between Chauncey street and the South Station when volumes of black smoke poured through the tube and permeated to adjoining subway systems. The officials of the road declare that there were no injuries resulting from the accident.

                    BOSTON'S FAMOUS SUBWAY

                    CHIEF ENGINEER CARSON TELLS HOW IT IS CONSTRUCTED.

                    Lecture Before Engineers' Club-Features of the Engineering Work on the Subway -Subways in Other Cities.

                    An exceedingly interesting and valuable lecture was given last evening in North Sheffield hall by Howard A. Carson, member of the American Society of Civil Engineers and chief engineer of the famous Boston subway. The lecture was given under the auspices of the Engineers' club and was largely attended by citizens as well as students.

                    Professor DuBois introduced Mr. Carson, who spoke on "Subways in Boston, London and Elsewhere." The lecture was illustrated by stereopticon views of the Boston subway and also of some of the European subways which Mr. Carson has visited.

                    The lecturer at the commencement explained why the Boston subway was built. "The population of Boston 130 years ago was less than 22,000; 100 years ago about 26,000; In 1830, In the remembrance of many, about 82,000, while today the city has about 500,000. The population of Boston doubles in about thirty-five years.

                    "The use of the streets for travel increases faster in proportion than the population of the city. In 1896 167,000,000 persons were carried by the street railways. While the population doubles only in twenty-five years, travel on the street railways doubles in about ten years.

                    "The streets are no wider now than they were one hundred years ago, and they are not able to do the work they are needed to do. If streets can't do the work required of them the natural thing to do is to build them wider or make new streets, but the cost is too great for this. Perhaps $100 a great for this cost. If you broaden the old streets, you must do the way a person does when a house is overcrowded and has not land to build new—by adding stories to the old. In the case of a street, you have to decide between an elevated way or a subway.

                    "The mere cost of erecting an elevated road is only about one-half or one-third of that of a subway, but the damage which has to be paid to adjacent property owners makes the cost of the two systems about the same. As to the convenience and comfort of the two methods, different persons are likely to hold different views."

                    Mr. Carson then explained an elevated road which is being constructed in Germany, where the cars are suspended from the track instead of running the rails.

                    "The Boston subway is being built under some of the most traveled streets of the city. For most of the distance, it is to have two tracks, but at points there are four tracks where the cars can run back without running to the end of the line. At the northern end, there is an incline where the cars can come to the surface. Stations for passengers are placed at convenient distances, usually one in about 1,000 feet.

                    "The retaining walls of the subway are of granite and concrete, mostly of concrete. There are two forms of construction employed in the roof, one made of steel and concrete and the other the brick arch.

                    "The subway is about twenty-four feet in width at the incline, where there are two tracks, and about sixteen feet high. In the middle of the subway, there are brick walls with open joints, so that the water can easily find its way into it, and the top is covered over with flags easily removed if the drain needs inspection or repair.

                    "At the passenger stations, there are two stairways, each fifteen feet in width. It was not intended at first to use elevators at all, but it may be thought desirable to adopt them at some stations later on.

                    "In the work of construction, many pipes were encountered which had to be removed or passed under. The work is being so performed as to cause the least possible hindrance to travel on the streets. In the daytime, one-third of the street is occupied for the plant and material used for the work, and the other two-thirds is left for travel. At night about two-thirds of the street is occupied in the work.

                    "Bridges are built over the excavations on a level with the street, so that one passing over them will hardly notice the fact. The work is done by what is known as the slice method, by which ten or a dozen sections are being excavated at the same time, no two being adjoining.

                    "There are eight fans placed at appropriate intervals to ventilate the tunnel, each fan being seven feet in diameter. It was feared by some that the excavations would weaken the foundations of some of the high buildings, but the work has so far advanced now that there is seen to be no danger."

                    Mr. Carson closed his lecture with a rapid description of subways in Budapest, Paris, London, and Glasgow, and also a description of the use of the shield in tunnelling.

                    The Boston sub-way bill, generally referred to as the Washington street sub-way bill, was signed by Governor Crane at 5.49 this afternoon. It had been enacted in the House an hour before, Its provisions are subject to ratification or rejection by the voters of Boston.

                    The Boston subway work is nearly completed. According to present prospects the total cost of the improvement will fall considerably within the engineer's estimate. The total cost of the subway to date is 4,043,313. The original estimate was $5,000,000. A tunnel under the harbor to East Boston is again being discussed.

                    ELECTRIC PRANKS IN THE BOSTON SUBWAY.

                    Three Injured, Firemen Shocked and Traffic Held Up for Two Hours.

                    Cables Short Circuited and Subway Filled With Dense, Choking Smoke.

                    Trouble Occurs Corner of Boylston and Tremont, Scene of the Disaster of March, 1897.

                    Through the uncontrollable pranks of the electric current that supplies motive power for the Elevated Railway trains, thousands of persons were delayed in getting to their homes this evening at the close of their day's work, three persons were seriously injured, several firemen received shocks, hundreds of people were badly frightened and all transportation service through the subway was shut off for nearly two hours.

                    The trouble occurred at the Boylston Street station of the subway, under the southeast corner of Boston Common. Two of the Elevated Road's power cables became short circuited and an explosion followed. The cables began to burn and the subway quickly filled with smoke.

                    All elevated trains running through the subway came to a standstill and were unable to proceed for nearly two hours. The surface cars, however, continued to enter the subway from the public gardens for a time. The smoke was so dense and choking that by the time the surface cars had reached Boylston street station the passengers had great difficulty in breathing and many of them were nearly exhausted when they staggered, blinded and choking up the exit stairs to the outer world. Finally, the surface cars too ceased running through the subway.

                    A company of firemen led by Chief Mullen were summoned from a neighboring fire station. The subway is equipped with hose, but the instant that the water was turned on the burning cables, every man who had hold of the hose received a severe shock.

                    Just about this time another explosion occurred in a manhole near the corner of Tremont and Eliot streets. Chief Mullen led a party of firemen to the spot where the burning cables had set fire to a pile of newspapers that had been thrown through a grating from the street above. Near this spot is a large steel ventilating fan, and in leaning against the fan Chief Mullen was knocked down by an electric shock. He was not seriously injured.

                    Three manholes at the Pleasant street entrance to the subway were the next to be affected, explosions occurring in all of them.

                    When three manholes blew out, three persons were slightly injured. Max Trautman, a 10-year-old newsboy, was reported to the secretary of war for being burned about the head; Andrew Reed of Appleton street was knocked down and severely bruised, and Miss Anna O. Donnell was knocked down and hurt by an iron gate of a store which was blown off its hinges by the force of the explosion. Several windows in the neighborhood were shattered and a delivery wagon was wrecked.

                    At 7:10 P. M., a little less than two hours from the time of the first explosion, the cars and trains were again running through the subway.

                    The corner of Boylston and Tremont street where tonight's series of explosions began, is the scene of the great explosion in March, 1897, when several people lost their lives and more than a score were seriously injured. At that time the subway was under construction and the trench became filled with gas which was ignited by a spark from an electric surface car.

                    BOSTON'S SUBWAY.

                    Work on Boston's fine subway is progressing even during cold weather. Modern methods of engineering overcome easily seeming obstacles and already a section directly under Tremont street near Park Street church is completed. The subway stretch problem is considered a settled fact that the work will be vigorously pushed to its completion.
